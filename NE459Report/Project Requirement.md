Your report is due : **Monday April 8**. 
submit an electronic copy (PDF) to your adviser, your second reader, and the course coordinator (me).  
They will need to grade your report by **April 22**.  

The length of the report should be approximately 5000 words or 25 pages. 

The report must contain at least the following; 
a) dated title page; 
b) summary of the report; 
c) table of contents;
d) the body of the report, suitably subdivided into sections;
e) conclusions and recommendations
f) references. 

The marking scheme of the report will be (25% for each of the below):

1. Project design (quality of project and/or experimental design; adequate amount of design-related activities in project; clarity of design choices in report)

2. Technical quality (clear problem definition; accurate theoretical analysis/simulation; clear experimental process description; in-depth and precise data analysis; proper conclusion drawing)

3. Organization and quality of presentation (proper title, abstract, introduction, conclusion, and references; scientific writing; organization of the report; grammatical errors; quality of figures and tables)

4. Others (difficulty of the problem; length of the report; quality of solution; research performance; critical thinking, overall merit)

As can be seen, part of the grade is awarded for project design.  Therefore, I suggest you 

include a discussion or outline of the design of your project in the body of your report.  

This may be done best by **having one section titled ‘project design’** and **in this section include**, for example (and as applicable), **why you designed your experiments/project the way you did**, **why you implemented certain methods to solve the research problem,** 
**why you selected particular materials**, 
**how you addressed cost and safety considerations and final product requirements**, etc.

So, **for example,** the sections in the body of your report could be: **(i) introduction, (ii) project design, (iii) methods/experiment, (iv) results and discussion, (v) conclusions and future work.**  Feel free to modify/delete/add sections as appropriate.

Email me if you have questions.
